Test Delay Functions
===========

This model tests basic delay functions:

- Delay1, Delay3, DelayN
- Delay1I, Delay3I

It does not test infinite order delays, as these require a separate representation, 
despite being similar in concept, and not all tools will choose to support it.

Note that this test is updated from a previous version in order to make it more robust.
