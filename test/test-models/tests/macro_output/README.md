Test Macros with more than one output
============

This model tests macros that have outputs.

I can't actually make this work - and the vensim help files say:

>The output arguments are variables that are defined inside of the macro, in addition to the output of the macro itself.  These are optional and must be separated from input arguments by a colon :.  **Their use is discouraged.**  When no outputs are specified, omit the colon :.  

So I'm putting this here as a note, but don't intend to develop it further, unless there is demand.
